A developer tool kit for increasing efficiency in minecraft plugin development/deployment.

This plugin can hook into any Jenkins configuration and automatically deploy Minecraft plugin jars to any server configured in a BungeeCord proxy network. Once a jar is deployed to a server, the server kicks all online users to a specified lobby server, and then reconnects users when the server has restarted. Users can also choose whether or not to listen to certain server/jar updates.

This project doubles as a BungeeCord Proxy plugin as well as Minecraft Spigot server plugin.
