A developer tool kit for increasing efficiency in minecraft plugin development/deployment.

This plugin will hook into a Jenkins configuration and automatically deploy Minecraft server jars to any server configured in a BungeeCord proxy network. Once a jar is deployed to a server, the server kicks all online users to a specified lobby server, and then reconnects users when the server has restarted.

This project doubles as a BungeeCord Proxy plugin as well as Minecraft Spigot server plugin.
